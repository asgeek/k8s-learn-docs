# Kubernetes Learning Project Documentation

## Overview
This repository contains comprehensive documentation for the Kubernetes learning project. It's designed to outline the journey of setting up, configuring, and managing a Kubernetes environment with a focus on microservices, CI/CD practices, Helm, Istio, and monitoring tools.

## Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to deepen understanding and practical skills in Kubernetes and related cloud-native technologies. This involves:
- Setting up a multi-node Kubernetes cluster.
- Implementing CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
- Creating and managing Helm charts for various microservices.
- Integrating and configuring Istio for advanced service mesh capabilities.
- Establishing a robust monitoring system using Prometheus and Grafana.

## Repository Structure
- `setup/`: Contains guidelines and notes for setting up the Kubernetes environment.
- `helm-charts/`: Documentation on Helm charts used or created for various microservices.
- `ci-cd/`: Detailed information on setting up and configuring continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
- `kubernetes/`: Specific configurations and insights related to Kubernetes.
- `istio/`: Documentation on integrating and configuring Istio within the Kubernetes environment.
- `monitoring/`: Setup and configuration details for monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
- `troubleshooting/`: A compilation of common issues and their solutions encountered during the project's progression.
- `contributing.md`: Guidelines on how to contribute to this documentation.
- `changelog.md`: A chronological log of significant changes and updates made to the documentation.
